# 🎓 N30 | Professional Evolution in Code and Finance
**Developer & Algorithmic Trader based in Port Moresby, PNG**

My technical foundation was established at the University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG), beginning with **Discrete Mathematics** and my first programming exercises in **Borland C++**. My academic curriculum expanded to include core languages such as **HTML, CSS, Perl, and Assembly**. This foundation was further solidified by teaching introductory programming using **Visual C++ in MS Visual Studio**.

My operational environment evolved in 2015 when I adopted open-source systems like **Linux Mint, Ubuntu, and Manjaro**. While professional requirements necessitated the use of **Windows** for specific tasks, I maintain a dedicated **Linux Mint environment** for focused development work.

Professionally, my initial specialization involved **student information systems**, demanding proficiency in data management using **SQL, MS Access, and VBA**. This deep expertise in data architecture served as the launchpad for my transition into **full-stack web development**. My focus transitioned from initial exploration of **JavaScript frameworks** to implementing robust and scalable solutions using **Python-based stacks (Django)**.

Currently, my discipline is centered on the financial markets, where I specialize in engineering **autonomous trading systems** using **MQL5** for MetaTrader 5. I continuously utilize advanced tools like **Gemini/ChatGPT** to optimize development workflows and deliver dependable, data-informed solutions.
